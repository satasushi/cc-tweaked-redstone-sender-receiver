# how to get it to work 
## 1. install level os on both computers (alternativly put it inside the directory of the computer)
### wget run https://install.leveloper.cc/
## 2. you need to place the files on each computer corelating to sender vs receiver. 
## 3. place down the choosen redstone strenght (distance from computer)
### you may need to change direction of redstone dependant on your use
## 4. run the lua programs on the computers
### optionally you can place a screen above the computers to test/ see current strenght of redstone

# feel free to use/change or include the code in your script

# future plans
## i might add rednet support(wireless), if i do you may have to modify the code to include multiple or just change the id. in other words the rednet sender/receiver will be seperate files.
## a version of seperately from the normal that includes all directions
## a varient that delays the redstone signal(customizable)
## a version so a redstone signal can be subtracted or added onto additional redstone inputs to make
### note that all versions will have a alternative, (rednet) in the case that the user wants to make different stuff with said script
